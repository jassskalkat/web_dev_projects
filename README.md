# web_dev_projects

Welcome to my repository!

This repository contains a collection of my front-end and back-end web development projects. As a web developer, I have a passion for creating visually appealing and functional websites and applications.

In the front-end section, you will find projects that showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects include responsive designs, animations, and interactive user interfaces.

The back-end section of this repository contains projects that demonstrate my proficiency in server-side programming languages like Python and Node.js. These projects are built using frameworks such as Flask and Express and focus on database management, API development, and server deployment.

I believe that the best way to improve as a developer is to practice, learn new skills and challenge yourself with new projects. I hope that you find inspiration from my work, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have.
