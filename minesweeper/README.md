# minesweeper

minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the player is presented with a grid of squares, some of which contain hidden mines. The player must 
reveal the squares without detonating any mines in order to win the game. The player can left-click to reveal a square, right-click to flag a 
mine, or middle-click to reveal all the squares around the one clicked. The game can be won by either revealing all the squares without mines or 
by flagging all the mines in the game.
