## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Rem & Em units
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- This was my first project where I only used rem/em units. So I tried to work on "fluidity". I will continue using rem & em.
- This project also gave me a lot of practice with flexbox.
- I made this webpage very responsive.

### Continued development

I want to work on learning

- Mobile-first Workflow
- Utilities
- More efficient ways to achieve responsiveness

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools: CSS flex-basis Property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex-basis.asp) - This helped me remember the flex-basis property.
