# Quizzicle

Quizzicle is a fun and interactive quiz application built using React. It allows users to create and play quizzes on various topics. The app is designed to resemble the popular online quiz platform Kahoot, with a visually appealing interface and engaging gameplay.

Upon opening the app, users are presented with a home screen where they can select to create a new quiz or join an existing one. After selecting to create a quiz, users can add multiple-choice questions with a customizable number of answers and mark the correct one. The app supports the addition of images to both questions and answers to make the quiz more visually appealing.

Once a quiz is created, users can invite others to join the game by sharing a unique code. The game screen shows the questions and answers, with a timer counting down for each question. Players can select their answers, and the correct answer is revealed after the timer runs out. Scores are tallied in real-time, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

Quizzicle is a fun way to test your knowledge and challenge your friends to a quiz. Give it a try and see how much you know!
