# pong game

Pong is a classic arcade game in which two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen and try to hit a ball back and forth, 
with the goal of scoring points by making the other player miss the ball. A web-based Pong game project would likely involve using HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript to create a virtual Pong game that can be played in a web browser. It could include features such as adjustable game 
speed, multiple difficulty levels, and the ability to play against the computer or another player online.
