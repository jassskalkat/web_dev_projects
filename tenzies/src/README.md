Tenzies

Tenzies is a simple yet fun dice game that can be played with two or more players. The game consists of rolling 10 dice with the objective of getting all of them to show the same number. The game can be played in rounds, with each round giving players a chance to roll the dice and try to get a Tenzies (all 10 dice showing the same number).
Objective

The objective of the game is to be the first player to achieve a Tenzies, which is when all 10 dice show the same number. Players can agree to play for a certain number of rounds or until a certain number of Tenzies are achieved, depending on how long they want the game to last.
Gameplay

At the start of each round, all players roll the 10 dice at the same time. Players then have the option to set aside any dice that show the desired number and re-roll the remaining dice. This process continues until a player achieves a Tenzies or all players have had an equal number of turns.
Scoring

The first player to achieve a Tenzies in a round is awarded one point. If no player achieves a Tenzies in a round, no points are awarded. Players can keep track of their points over multiple rounds to determine the winner of the game.
Conclusion

Tenzies is a fun and easy-to-learn dice game that can be played with friends and family. It's perfect for parties, gatherings, or any time you want to have some fun and friendly competition.
